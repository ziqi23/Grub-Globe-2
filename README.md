# grubGlobe

_Social, interactive, and AI-augmented MERN fullstack app for exploring diverse recipes from around the world_

### Background

grubGlobe is a fullstack app to answer the question "what should I cook?" We designed grubGlobe for the culinary adventurer-at-heart who wants to explore the best recipes from around the world. And not only that, we wanted to make it as easy as possible to get cookin' and track one's culinary journey.
